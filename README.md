- Easy navigation using the mouse and keyboard.
- Feature-rich MIDI editor.
  - Support for importing VSQX (Vocaloid 4) tracks.
- Selective backward compatibility with UTAU.
  - OpenUtau aims to solve problems with fewer steps. It is not designed to replicate UTAU features exactly.
- Extensible real-time phonetic editing.

- Smooth preview/rendering experience.
  - Pre-rendering allows OpenUtau to render vocals before playback, saving time during editing and tuning.

- Easy-to-use plugin system.
- Versatile resampling engine interface.
  - Compatible with most UTAU resamplers.
- Runs on Windows (32/64 bit), macOS, and Linux.

### What it doesn't do
- While OpenUtau can do very minimal mixing, it will not replace your digital audio workstation of choice.
- OpenUtau does not aim for Vocaloid compatibility, except for some limited features.
