        GitHub issues are for reporting bugs and crashes. Vague help requests are not efficiently handled here.
        For help request please read [Getting-Started](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau/wiki/Getting-Started) and [FAQ](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau/wiki/FAQ) and other wiki pages first.
        If still not resolved, help requests are better handled in the Discord server or QQ group.
